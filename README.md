# **Attendance System Based on Geofencing**

This project is an advanced attendance tracking system that leverages geofencing technology to ensure accurate and reliable attendance marking. It integrates geolocation features to validate users' presence within a predefined area before recording attendance.

---

## **Features**
- **Geofencing-based validation**: Ensures users are within a specific location to mark attendance.
- **Real-time location tracking**: Utilizes GPS for accurate location detection.
- **Secure and efficient**: Prevents proxy attendance through geolocation verification.
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop platforms.
- **Customizable geofence radius**: Allows administrators to set the permissible geofencing area.

---

## **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: Dart (Flutter framework)
- **Backend**: REST APIs for data handling (can be integrated with Node.js, Django, or other frameworks).
- **Database**: Firebase/SQLite (or any chosen database for attendance records).
- **Geolocation Services**: Google Maps API or similar geolocation SDKs.
